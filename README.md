The construction of the required hardware, especially in the handling of mains voltage (230V, 110V, ...), is carried out on one's own responsibility, local guidelines and regulations must also be observed especially in connection with water and pool!
All explanations about the hardware are only indications of how it is technically feasible, security and legal provisions are not discussed here!

## Prerequisites:
The described installation method and dependencies fit to ubuntu 24.04, the homectld work also with other Linux distributions

Language pack 'de_DE.UTF-8' is required as language package (`dpkg-reconfigure locales`)
Set system timezone, for example Berlin `timedatectl set-timezone Europe/Berlin`

# Building and installing by source

## Preliminary
Update your system
```
apt update
apt dist-upgrade
```

Perform all following steps as root user! Either by getting root or by prefix each command with sudo.
To become root type: `sudo -i`

## Installation of the MySQL Database
It's not required to host the database local at the Raspberry. A remote database is supported as well.

```
apt -y install mariadb-server
```
or if you like mariadb-server 10.6 on ubuntu 20.04 follow this instructions:
https://community.hetzner.com/tutorials/how-to-install-mariadb-10-6-on-ubuntu-20-04

Set the database root (db admin) password during installation!

### Local database setup:
If the database server is located locally (on same host as the daemon):

```
> mysql -u root -Dmysql -p
  CREATE DATABASE homectl charset utf8;
  CREATE USER 'homectl'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'homectl';
  GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON homectl.* TO 'homectl'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'homectl';
  flush privileges;
```

### Remote database setup:
if the database is running remote, or you like to have remote access to the database:
```
> mysql -u root -Dmysql -p
 CREATE DATABASE homectl charset utf8;
 CREATE USER 'homectl'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'homectl';
 GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON homectl.* TO 'homectl'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'homectl';
 flush privileges;
```

### install the build dependencies

```
apt -y install build-essential libssl-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev uuid-dev libcap-dev libsystemd-dev
apt -y install libjansson-dev libmariadb-dev liblua5.3-dev mosquitto-clients jq jo bc
```

# If you integrate bluetooth devices

```apt -y install libbluetooth-dev```

# If you NOT use a global mosquitto borker somewhere in your local network
```apt -y install mosquitto```

#### Raspberry Pi
```
apt -y install wiringpi
```
#### Odroid with Ubuntu
```
apt -y install libwiringpi-dev libwiringpi2 odroid-wiringpi
```

### get and install libwebsock
We need to install it manually in case the version shipped with the distribution is to old
(we need at least version v4.3.0)

if the version shipped with the distribution is okay simple
```apt -y install libwebsockets-dev```

else get it from git
```
cd /usr/src/
git clone https://github.com/warmcat/libwebsockets.git
cd libwebsockets
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make install
ldconfig
```

### get, build and install the homectld

```
cd /usr/src/
git clone https://github.com/horchi/linux-homectld/
cd linux-homectld
make clean all
make install
```
Now the home control daemon is installed in folder `/usr/local/bin`
Check `/etc/homectld/daemon.conf` file for setting of your database login. If you have used the defaults above no change is needed.

# One Wire Sensors:

### Enable One Wire Sensors at your Raspberry PI
To make the sensors available to the Raspberry PI you have to load the `w1-gpio` module by registering it in `/etc/modules`
(here in detail : http://www.netzmafia.de/skripten/hardware/RasPi/Projekt-Onewire/index.html)

```
echo "w1-gpio" >> /etc/modules
echo "w1_therm" >> /etc/modules
echo "dtoverlay=w1-gpio,gpioin=4,pullup=on" >> /boot/config.txt
```

Reboot to apply this settings!

The homectld checks automatically if there are 'One Wire Sensors' connected, each detected sensor will be
configurable via the web interface.

# Time to first start of homectld
```
systemctl start homectld
```

# And enable it for automatic start at boot
```
systemctl enable homectld
```


### to check it's current state call

```
systemctl status homectld
```

it should now 'enabled' and in state 'running'!

### also check the syslog about errors of the homectld, this will show all its current log messages

```
grep -i "error" /var/log/homectld.log
```


# The WEB interface:

The default username and password for login to the web interface is:
```
User: homectl
Password: homectl
```

## Connect to the WEB interface:

The default Port is 61109. You reacg the WEB interface with this url (replace your-ip):

http://your-ip:61109

### URL Parameters

kiosk   - start in kiosk mode:

// 0 - with menu,    normal dash symbols, use normal-widget-height-factor
// 1 - without menu, big dash symbols,    use kiosk-widget-height-factor
// 2 - with menu,    big dash symbols,    use kiosk-widget-height-factor
// 3 - with menu,    big dash symbols,    use normal-widget-height-factor

heightFactor
group
backTime
page - specify the start page (dashboard, setup, chart, ...)
dash - specify the start page of the dashboard (dashbord ID)

For example to start in kiosk mode 2

http://your-ip:61109/index.html&kiosk=2



### Fist steps to enable data logging:

1. Log in to the web interface
2. Go to Setup -> IO Setup
3. Select the values you like to display and record and store your settings

### Points to check
- reboot the device to check if homectld is starting automatically during startup


# Backup
Backup the data of the homectl database including all recorded values:

```
homectld-backup.sh
```

This will create the at least this dumps:

```
config-dump.sql.gz
errors-dump.sql.gz
jobs-dump.sql.gz
menu-dump.sql.gz
samples-dump.sql.gz
schemaconf-dump.sql.gz
sensoralert-dump.sql.gz
smartconfig-dump.sql.gz
valuefacts-dump.sql.gz
timeranges-dump.sql.gz
hmsysvars-dump.sql.gz
scripts-dump.sql.gz
```

To import the backup:
```
gunzip NAME-dump.sql.gz
mysql -u homectl -phomectl -homectl <  NAME-dump.sql.gz
```
replace NAME with the name of the dump

# Additional Hardware

## BMS
If you like to connect a Battery-Management-Systems like them used commonly from LionTron a you can use
the `bmsmqtt` service shipped with the `homectld`. Jus configure it in `/etc/default/bmsmqtt`, enable and start it:
```
systemctl enable bmsmqtt.service
systemctl start bmsmqtt.service
```

## One Wire Sensors
The One Wire Sensors are managed by the `w1mqtt` service shipped with `homectld`, this service is enables by default and can be disabled if not needed.
Disable `w1mqtt`
```
systemctl disable w1mqtt.service
```
The `w1mqtt` service is configured in `/etc/default/w1mqtt`

## 433 MHz Radio Sensors (RTL-433)

A RTL Radio/USB adapter like the https://amzn.eu/d/bKBwTOO is needed. As Sensor you van use any compatible, mostly all 433Mht radio sensors.
For the interface to the `homectld` you can use `rtl-433` which is includes in most linix distributions, whis can configured to write the data directly
to MQTT where it's read and paresed by the `homectld`.
To install the `rtl-433` package:
```
apt -y install rtl-433
```
To start the rtl-433 service a Systemd unit file is shipped with the `homectld`, install, enable and start it by:
```
cd linux-homectld
cp contrib/rtl433.service /etc/systemd/system/
systemctl enable rtl433.service
systemctl start rtl433.service
```
To change the MQTT borker connection (host, port, ...) adjust it in `/etc/systemd/system/rtl433.service` and restart the service.

## Caravan Industries (CI) Bus Interface

The CI bus adapter https://www.fischl.de/usblini/ is a lightweight solution.
Details descibed here ./thetford/README.md

# Information / HINTS

## MySQL HINTS
If you cannot figure out why you get Access denied, remove all entries from the user table that
have Host values with wildcards contained (entries that match `%` or `_` characters).
 A very common error is to insert a new entry with `Host='%'` and `User='some_user'`, thinking that this allows you to specify localhost to connect from the same machine.
The reason that this does not work is that the default privileges include an entry with `Host='localhost'` and `User=''`. Because that entry has a Host value `localhost` that is more specific than `%`, it is used in preference to the new entry when connecting from localhost! The correct procedure is to insert a second entry with `Host='localhost'` and `User='some_user'`, or to delete the entry with `Host='localhost'` and `User=''`.
After deleting the entry, remember to issue a `FLUSH PRIVILEGES` statement to reload the grant tables.

To analyze this you can show all users:
```
use mysql
SELECT host, user FROM user;
```
